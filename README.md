====
This basic script makes standard calculations on Python
----
In order to practice something new, I implemented colour scheme with [Colorama] (https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) <br>
It requires pip <br>
###TO RUN IT: <br>
• pip install colorama <br>
• With any preferred compiler run "Calc.py"
